          <h1>Our Chief</h1>
          <Col md={3}>
            Referring to the CEO or Chief Executive Officer of PETPUJAA's Pizza,
            as of my knowledge cutoff date of 2021, it was AADESH SATPUTE .
            It's worth noting that companies can have multiple
            C-level executives, such as a CFO (Chief Financial Officer) or a CMO
            (Chief Marketing Officer), but the CEO is typically the
            highest-ranking executive in the company.
